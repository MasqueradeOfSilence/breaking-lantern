# breaking-lantern
For Stowaway -- hopefully, I can actually finish this effect before someone else takes it. 

**STEPS:**
1) Draw the lantern
2) Draw the lantern *breaking* like a storyboard
3) Begin doing test-driven development for animation using Python scripting
4) Use the fracture node and ground plane to begin the break
5) Begin the flame
